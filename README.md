**Pinder - CS422 Final Project**

As an owner of a cat, I'm really scared of losing him. On Facebook,
there are lots of group for finding pets, but at this time those groups are kind of being used on the wrong purpose.
In addition, Facebook created Group feature not for any specific purpose. So I decided to make an Android application 
dedicated to finding pet by connecting people who found or lost their pets. The application is like a social community, 
but has been minimalized some basic features like reactions, comments, shares, etc... Only features that are helpful for
information of lost/found pet.
